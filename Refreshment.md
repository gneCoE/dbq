Due to pandemic, as a precaustionary measure, it was decided not to serve refreshments in the hall. 
Instead, Rs. 200 per day for 5 days was alloted to each of the three resource persons for the meals/refreshments.

Total Amount per Resource person: Rs. 200 × 5 = Rs. 1000  

Overall Amount: Rs. 1000 × 3 = Rs. 3000
