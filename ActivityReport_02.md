### Course Content

Keeping in view the success of Run-1 of the SDT and due to request of participants (other students and teachers), run-2 of the Skill
Development Training on "Efficient, Trackable and Sustainable Workflow" was conducted from December 30, 2020 to January 05, 2021
with a different and  more sustainable approach.

The need of installing software was reduced to minimal, and all practice was done on the server, which also gave experience to participants to publish content in web-ready form.


To address the issues associated with poor workflow, and making sure that the computer resources are used
efficiently and with the provision to track changes, TEQIP-III sponsored skill development training on
"Efficient, Trackable and Sustainable Workflow" was organised by Examination Branch of 
Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC) in association with Departments of Civil Engineering 
and Computer Science Engineering.   

As intended, this Skill development training imparted the participants all the necessary tools,
hands-on practical sessions to solve all the issues related to documentation and its version control,
and made sure that computer resources are used efficiently (thus making the process green) and with the provision to track 
who proposed the changes or who drafted what and who approved that, later any time, and roll-back, if there is necessity of that.

This one week training which was suitable for all professionals commenced from December 05, 2020 onwards on a self-paced mode. 
The skill development training concluded successfully with a valedictory function. There was a diverse range of participants in 
the course from the Senior faculty including HoDs, faculty members from all cadres, students to non-teaching staff. In order to deliver the course 
content effectively and efficiently, an excellent learning platform and content management system called Moodle was used. 
This platform enabled the participants to learn and attain hands on experience at their own pace. The training program also encouraged peer learning 
by discussing doubts among participants at the dedicated forum. Furthermore, keeping in view the changing scenario, the training program
emphasized on paper-less and thus a sustainable approach towards documentation by using available open-source powerful tools.   

### Expected Benefits Derived and How it will be helpful to the College

**The successful participants after attending the training program are expected to be able to** 

- Manage version control of every document easily, making it easy to explore the changes that occurred to it at different points of time.
- Keep all files necessary for a particular project in a central place (repository), and give access to authorised persons, with tracking ability. 
To that central repository team members can add documents, images, links, graphs, etc.
- Review other peopleâ€™s documents, add comments to certain lines or the overall document, and suggest changes.
- Maintain online backup of data. Everyone who has rights can access the data.

During the valedictory function, feedback from participants and course reviewers was taken. The participants expressed their joy in learning new skills
during the training program. One of the participants said that, if implemented, such a version control system can prove to be a revolutionary
step for the organisation to address issues related to effective management of documentation.

As far as our institute is concerned, already a shift and a positive inclination towards this version control system can be seen in the college. 
As a result of which we are also expecting the release of the latest College Newsletter through the use of GitHub.
Organising team is excited to see how it goes and would happily extend help in every possible way to bring this revolutionary change.
