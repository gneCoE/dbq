This one week training suitable for all professionals commenced from December 02, 2020 
onwards with an inaugural session. Course Co-ordinator, Dr H S Rai welcoming all the
participants outlined the essence of the training program. He said that the functioning 
of any individual or an organisation is dependent on its documentation. He added that
even a small document, like an office memo or a notice undergoes a number of revisions
and every task involves multiple persons. Most of us, most of the time maintain various 
revisions by giving appropriate names, and sending latest edition / version to other 
involved (through pen-drive or e-mails)for incorporating in their work or for review.
This is definitely an inefficient approach resulting in poor workflow. 
Dr Rai added that this workshop will emphasize on Version Control System (VCS) 
which will address the highlighted issues and will result in efficient, trackable and
sustainable workflow.

Dr Sehijpal Singh, Principal, GNDEC, while addressing the audience said that efficient workflow
is the need of every organisation as poor documentation often leads to mismanagement and wastage 
of lot of resources. He extended best wishes to the participants and wished for a fruitful outcome
of this training program. Guest and Reviewer of the course, Dr Sukhjit Shera, emphasized that efficient 
flow of work is need of an hour and is crucial for success of any organisation. He expressed his
heartiest congratulation to the organising team for bringing forward a much needed training program.
In the end, Prof Yuvraj Singh extended a vote of thanks.
